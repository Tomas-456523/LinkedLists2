*  This program is a student database that uses a linked list, using my partner's Node.h and Node.cpp files. You can
*  ADD a new student, which will be added to the list in increasing ID order. You can DELETE the student, and PRINT
*  all the students' data. You can also print the AVERAGE of all their GPAs, ask for HELP to print all the valid
*  commands, or QUIT the program.
